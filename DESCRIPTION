Description: MAGEMinConnectR provides a wrapper to access MAGEMin 
  (https://github.com/ComputationalThermodynamics/MAGEMin_C.jl), 
  a julia package to calculate phase equlibrium. Specifically, it does single-point minimization 
  for given P, T and composition (X), allowing the user to wrap this into their own R code.
